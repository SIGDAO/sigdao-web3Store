            To create a token, an <b>active Signum account</b> (creator account) with a few SIGNA (15 SIGNA are quite
            sufficient)
            is required. The process is divided into <b>two phases: Registration and Activation</b>. The whole process,
            taking into
            account the confirmation from the Signum network, takes about 10 minutes. The process is as follows:
        </p>
        <ol class="mdc-typography--body1">
            <li>
                to register you must "login" with your creator account, that will receive the donations later
            </li>
            <li>
                fill in the form as completely as possible and confirm the process with your secret passphrase
            </li>
            <li>
                wait until the registration is completed (about 4 minutes)
            </li>
            <li>
                finally, activate the token. That means you have to send a small amount (5 SIGNA) to the token
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="mdc-typography--body1">
            Once activated, the token becomes publicly visible and can receive donations.

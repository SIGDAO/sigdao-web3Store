    <p class="mdc-typography--body1">
        To create a token, an <b>active Burst account</b> (creator account) with a few BURST (15 BURST are quite sufficient)
        is required. The process is divided into <b>two phases: Registration and Activation</b>. The whole process, taking into
        account the confirmation from the Burstcoin network, takes about 10 minutes. The process is as follows:
    </p>
    <ol class="mdc-typography--body1">
        <li>
            to register you must "login" with your generator account, that will receive the donations later
        </li>
        <li>
            fill in the form as completely as possible and confirm the process with your secret passphrase
        </li>
        <li>
            wait until the registration is completed (about 4 minutes)
        </li>
        <li>
            activate the token, i.e. send a small amount to the token
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="mdc-typography--body1">
        Once activated, the token becomes publicly visible and can receive donations.

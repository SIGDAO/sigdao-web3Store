# STORE.SIGDAO.IO: Your Launchpad to the Future of Decentralized Applications

The __Sigdao Web3Store__ is a platform to register tools and applications for the [Signum](https://signum.network/) eco-system. 
On one hand, this platform serves as a kind of application store, but also as an exhibition center for developers. 

## Digital Asset using Signum Smart Contracts

Each registered entry is represented through a digital (cryptographic) asset/token using [Signum Smart Contracts](./assets/SmartContract.java) and is stored in the 
Signum blockchain. The registrar is the initial owner of that token. Therefore, the token is a so called [Non-Fungible Token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token) (NFT):
the token can only be owned by one person at a time, but it's possible to transfer it to another person, e.g. by selling it.

Furthermore, the token can receive amounts from other Signum Accounts. The received amount will be redirected 
(subtracting an inherent contract execution fee) to the owner. The number of transactions (considered as donations) 
is counted, and the received amounts are summed up, and kept in the Smart Contract. This can be used as a success indicator.

## Overview

SIGDAO.IO is more than just a dApp store. It's a vibrant ecosystem where innovative dApp projects are launched, funded, and empowered to thrive. Whether you're a developer, investor, or enthusiast, SIGDAO provides the tools and community support you need to succeed in the Web3 landscape.

## Key Features

### Launch Your dApp with Ease

- **Seamless Onboarding**: Our intuitive platform makes it simple for startupers to list their dApp projects and reach a global audience. You can focus on developing your idea while we handle the logistics.

- **IP Protection**: We understand the importance of protecting your intellectual property. Your dApp's code is securely stored on the Signum blockchain, ensuring its integrity and ownership.

- **Community Validation**: Get valuable feedback and validation from the SIGDAO community through voting on your project. This helps you refine your dApp and build a strong user base.

### Get Funded by the Community

- **SIGDAO Token**: Users can invest in promising dApp projects using the SIGDAO token, providing you with the resources you need to develop and grow your dApp.

- **Decentralized Funding**: Unlike traditional venture capital, funding on SIGDAO is based on community support, giving you more control over your project's direction. 

- **Transparency and Trust**: All transactions on the SIGDAO platform are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and accountability in every funding cycle.

- **The RULES of the Voting Game**: We will write some lines about every startup in the program, here are the rules :

üé§ One phrase pitch - We will try to understand the essential value proposition just by their one-sentence pitch.
üë®‚Äçüéì We analyze the team - being the most pivotal aspect of a startup.

Here, I am just stating that we are investing in the company, and having fun analyzing the business idea.
üí° We will analyze the potential of the idea as it is. Not of potential pivots in the same business area.
üåà Judgment. We analyse and comment the potential values, be sure these start-ups are already doing great and really hope for them, they will all become unicorns ü¶Ñ

For every one of these dApp projects, we drew two analysis criteria:
Example:
#IDEA dAPP108: web3 dApp store - List, Vote, Invest
Website: https://sigdao.io
Sector: dApp Store
Potential (1 to 5 ‚≠ê) ‚Äî A appreciation on the potential of the project.
Vote Raised (üí∏) ‚Äî A proxy of community voting & validating round.

Analysis - False good idea, I am bearish on this.
It‚Äôs very complicated to fight the inertia and to ‚Äòpush‚Äô someone to take photos of all its dishes.

üü¢ Positive:
Direct Link to Value: Proove by 1+1 that you can increase margin for markets, and your product will become indispensable.
High Differentiation: Positive loop, the more info they have, the more their algorithm will be performing.

üü† low B2B Need : the model is very hard. Everytime you talk to startuper their main need is just ‚Äòwe‚Äôd like to have more capital‚Äô, and both startuper and user are OK in keeping a scrappy platform to register.

üî¥ Negative: Product Risk: Their product must be easy to implement and being able to deliver the expected results.


### Own the Future of Web3
